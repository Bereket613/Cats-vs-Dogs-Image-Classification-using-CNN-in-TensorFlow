# Cats vs Dogs Image Classification using CNN

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented with TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled images of cats and dogs, achieving a classification accuracy of at least 63%. Data augmentation techniques are applied to enhance the model’s performance by generating more diverse training samples.

### Requirements:
- TensorFlow 2.0
- Keras
- Python 3.6+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Setup and Installation:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cats-vs-dogs-classification.git
   cd cats-vs-dogs-classification
Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Open and run the Jupyter notebook or the Python script in Google Colaboratory to start training the model.

Steps to Run:
Download the Dataset: The dataset is automatically downloaded in the notebook.

Preprocess the Data: Image data is preprocessed using ImageDataGenerator and split into training, validation, and test sets.

Train the Model: The model is trained on the training dataset with data augmentation techniques to reduce overfitting.

Evaluate the Model: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and loss metrics.

Predict New Images: After training, the model is used to classify new test images as either cats or dogs.

Model Architecture:
The CNN model includes the following layers:

Conv2D layers for feature extraction

MaxPooling2D layers to reduce dimensionality

Dense layers to classify the images

Dropout layers to prevent overfitting

Training Details:
Optimizer: Adam

Loss function: Binary Cross-Entropy

Metrics: Accuracy

Data Augmentation: Horizontal flip, rotation, zoom, etc.

Evaluation:
The model is evaluated on a test set and achieves an accuracy of over 63%. You can further improve accuracy by experimenting with hyperparameters like batch size and epochs.
