# Cats-vs-Dogs-Image-Classification-using-CNN-in-TensorFlow
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and achieves over 63% accuracy. Data augmentation techniques are applied to improve performance and reduce overfitting.
